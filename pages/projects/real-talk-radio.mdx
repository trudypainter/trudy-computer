    For the summer of 2020, I worked on Real Talk Radio under 
    Ekene Ijeoma with the Poetic Justice Group at the MIT Media Lab. 
    
    Real Talk Radio is a continuous broadcasting system. 
    It contains spoken word song introductions in Black music 
    from hip hop to jazz as a form of Black thought and knowledge.

**Project Overview**

Real Talk Radio is a series of software-generated live-streamed sound and video works.
It is composed of a never-ending mix of spoken-word intros,
outros, interludes, and skits from hip-hop songs alongside
shout-outs from Black creatives.

As a vocal portrait and sonic meditation, it explores multi-genre and multigenerational
Black thought and expression in the US.

The first edition of Real Talk Radio features the top 100 musicians with the
most popular spoken-word song segments. All editions are free and accessible to
the public 24/7, both over the phone and online.

This project is a part of the Poetic Justice Group at the MIT Media Lab and is
currently in development.

**My Contributions**

I was a fullstack web developer for Real Talk radio
and built the first version of the system.

Since this was a primarily curatorial project,
there needed to be a flexible way to browse and edit the snippets
to be included in the livestream.

**Google Sheets Backend**

I used a crafty approach to build the first version.
I used Google Sheets as a database, which allowed for
easy manipulation and browsing of data.

This approach was free and quick to spin up. The curators
were also familiar with using Sheets. However, later on
Sheets was difficult to query data from for the
frontend livestream. The backend had to be rebuilt after
my summer internship.

**Song Scraping**

To populate the database with songs for curators to select, I wrote a
Python script to scrape
the web for top songs, segmented by spoken interludes (using lyric scraping).

This script automatically uploaded all the songs to a Google Sheet where
the curator could easily manipulate all of the data. This approach
jumpstarted the curation process and made it easier for the curator
to make decisions about what content to include in the live stream.
