    In January 2022, I took a DJ class and had a blast creating my first mix.
    However, I quickly realized that the mix didn't sound great to others due to
    the differing beats of the songs.

    To try to help out my DJ process, I built
    a Spotify library explorer that matches songs by BPM using the Spotify API.

**User Experience**

The user experience is divided into three main steps:
selecting a seed song, building a setlist, and exporting to Spotify.

In the user flow, I priortized the user's ability to _browse_
instead of _search + receive_ songs.

**01. Seed Song Selection**

First, the user picks a seed song. This song determines the BPM of the playlist.
BPM stands for beats per minute, and it is a measure of the tempo of a song.
In DJing, it is useful to match the BPM of songs to create a smooth transition.

To help the user browse their library, the app displays a user’s recently
listened to tracks as suggestions, or the user can search for a song.
This song sets the standard BPM (top left corner), and all other songs
recommended
are matched to this BPM.

**02. Setlist Building**

Next, the user enters the playlist building mode.
They can build a playlist by clicking on album covers to
add them to the top playlist bar.

By clicking on “NEW SECTION”
in the bottom right, a user can create a new section of potential
songs to choose from. Each section type is either:

- Genre → all songs in a given Spotify genre (generated by [Every Noise](https://everynoise.com/))
- Artist → all compatible songs in an artist’s discography
- Playlist → compatible songs in a user’s saved playlist

The sections separate the chunks of songs into different categories,
so the user can compare + contrast different options.

**03. Exporting to Spotify Library**

Once a user finishes building a playlist in the top bar, the playlist can be exported to the user’s library. Then, the user can start from the beginning with a new session.

**Video Demo**

Unfortunately, the Spotify API team rejected my request for an app extension because it's a "hobby project". If you would like to use it, I can add you to the list of approved accounts!

Below is the video demo I submitted to try to get it approved.
