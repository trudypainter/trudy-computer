### Inspiration

I think about [this tweet](https://twitter.com/thesephist/status/1642735530562527234?s=20) a lot.
I agree that the final form of working with large language models should not be
"sending texts." This graph experiment was a way for me to explore some other forms
of interacting with large language models.

### What is it?

LLM Axis is a customizable word organization graph using GPT4. It's a way to
explore the relationships between words and concepts. The graph axes and word list are fully customizable.

Below are some examples of the graph in action.

### Prompt Scaffolding

When you click "Reorganize Words," the app will send a prompt to GPT4 to
get the positions for each of the words in the word list.

The prompt expects a JSON format response from GPT4 to render the words in HTML.
