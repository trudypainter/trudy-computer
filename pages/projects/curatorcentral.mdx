    Curator Central was my final group project for MIT's Software Studio Class.
    I worked with Andrew Stoddard, Maria Ascanio, and Stephanie Howe. Curator
    Central is a community platform to connect more deeply with museum works,
    using the Harvard Art API to enhance artworks in Harvard Art Museum’s
    galleries.

**Project Pitch**

Museums are in need of our help. Many people feel that museums are
antiquated and aren’t geared towards younger generations.
Museums are looking to change this by enhancing visitors’
experiences, and many have moved to a “[participatory model](https://www.participatorymuseum.org/),”
centered around the visitor experience. Often serving as a
cultural center, museums empower visitors to connect to their
broader communities. Museums need tools to facilitate conversations
around exhibits and promote distribution of visitor input.

**Recogntion**

My group was selected for an Excellent Project Award at the end of the class. We were recognized for our
fluid implementations of:

01\. Scanning QR codes to collect artworks and

02\. Enabling users to leave threaded comments _directly_ on an artwork.

**01. Scanning**

In Curator Central, scanning is facilitated through QR codes
associated with each artwork. Visitors at the museum can scan these QR
codes using their mobile devices. After scanning, the app adds the artwork to the user's personal collection within the platform.
This allows users to track the art they were drawn to and learn more about the
artwork after leaving the museum.

**02. Commenting**

The commenting process in Curator Central is uniquely interactive.
Users can tap on a specific location on the artwork
image on their device to place their comment.
This allows users to comment on a _specific_ part of the artwork,
facilitating more focused discussions.

Users can have these discussions with each other through "threaded"
comments. Multiple users can add their thoughts to a specific part of
the artwork.
