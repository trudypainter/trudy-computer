# What’s the combination of a red sports car and a blue truck?

It’s a simple question you and I both understand. But how do we reach a shared idea of this complex combination?

# Meshup

[Meshup](http://18.27.79.107:5000/) is a tool I created with [Kevin Dunnell](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dunnell/overview/) at the MIT Media Lab’s [Viral Communications Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/viral-communications/overview/) to accelerate synthesizing complex ideas.

A general adversarial network (GAN) is a type of machine learning model that can generate new images. We trained a GAN model on images of cars → so we had a machine learning model that understood images of cars and could in turn generate new images of cars.

We then created an interface to explore all the possible outputs from the model, given influencing cars. When a user clicks on a car, the synthesized image output in the center is nudged towards the influencing car.

### My contributions

In the fall of 2021, I worked as a fullstack developer on this project. Below are my technical contributions.

- I learned how to interface with a machine learning model and write APIs to access it from the web. I used Docker to deploy this machine learning model and corresponding web app.

- I refactored the original frontend (written in plain HTML + JS) to use React (more modular).

- I added user image upload functionality. Images had to be scrubbed and parsed by the machine learning model before being used by the web app

- I added realtime, multi-user functionality. I coordinated loading new images and generating new outputs across multiple user sessions using web sockets.

Below is demo of the multi-user prototype.

Personal note: I thought this project was awesome. It pointed to exciting elements of getting humans closer to the feedback loop of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

My supervisor [Kevin Dunnell](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dunnell/overview/) and I were fascinated by modeling + exploring the latent space (all the possible generative outputs) of machine learning models and continued research with the [Latent Lab](http://www.trudy.computer/latent-lab) project.
