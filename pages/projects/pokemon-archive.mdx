# POKEMON ARCHIVE

I love Pokemon cards, but I couldn't find anywhere to see them all in one place. So, I made a web scraper that collected all of the images of Pokemon cards online, then uploaded them all to an Are.na channel.

The Are.na channel is large (over 10,000 images). So, it takes a really long time to load.

This is the [repository](https://github.com/trudypainter/pokemon-archive) for how I made the scraper and uploaded the images.

And, this is the [Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/trudy-painter/every-pokemon-card-uz5ifttjceo).
