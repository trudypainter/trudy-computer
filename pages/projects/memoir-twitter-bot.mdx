    My friend Natalie kept sending me silly memoir titles she was coming up with. 
    
    I had also just completed a computational poetry workshop with [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/). 
    I wanted to try out my own project, so I made this Twitter bot to generate 
    memoir titles usingÂ [Tracery](https://tracery.io/).
