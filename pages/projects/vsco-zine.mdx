    I love taking pictures and zines. I thought the process of making photography 
    zines was too tedious. 
    
    I made this little Python server to generate zines from VSCO using theÂ 
    [Bindery JS library](https://evanbrooks.info/bindery/). All someone has to do 
    is enter their VSCO username and the zine will be generated for them.
