    [Bard, now known as Gemini,](https://gemini.google.com/app) is Google's AI chat interface.

    I worked on the small team to align communication strategy for Bard on social media.
    I concepted, scripted, and starred in Google's short form video advertisements.

    Below is a coding video tutorial I made for Bard. I had to find a way to make coding fun and engaging for a general audience.
    The video has over 40 million views across Instagram, Tik Tok, and YouTube.
