    In December 2023, Google launched [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction), a multimodal AI model that could understand and
    generate text, images, and audio.

    I worked on the small team tasked to create a series of promotional videos for the launch.
    Multimodal AI was a new and complex concept, so we had to create a series of videos that would
    explain the technology to a wide audience.

**Hands on with Gemini**

    One of the videos was a 6 minute long demo of the AI in action, that used abridged versions of
    the prompts. I helped with the concepting and production of the video, alongisde a team of 3 other brilliant filmmakers.

    **Controversy**

![](/gemini-launch/tc.png)

    The launch was an overnight success. However, the launch video's popularity
    was followed by a wave of scrutiny.

In the video, it was unclear that the prompts voiced aloud were abridged versions of
the actual prompts sent to the model.

    The underlying prompts for anyone to recreate the results are outlined in this [developer post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html).

**Personal Note**

I am EXTREMELY glad news outlets were criticizing this launch.
I believe it's important to hold companies accountable for their claims, especially when it comes
to introducing complex technology.

It shifted my values from making AI feel _magical_ towards making it feel _approachable_.

**Snackable Snippets**

    Another series of videos from the launch (facing less scrutiny) were 1 minute videos demonstrating novel use cases,
    like [picking an outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP2pNdCRT5M) or [combining different emojis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8kRJPXCW0).

 **Coding Snippet**

    I was responsible for concepting, scripting, and voicing the use case video for coding.

    I personally love fractal trees... especially ties between biomimicry and code, so I made a video highlighting
    the model's ability to generate code by bridging patterns across different domains.
