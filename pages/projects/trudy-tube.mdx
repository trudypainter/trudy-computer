I was frustrated that I couldn’t see every song I listened to on Spotify.
So, as a personal project, I made a Spotify listening archiver to
collect every single song I listen to and generate interactive listening charts,
plotted by time of day.

_Note: This project has been through MANY iterations. It's currrently on its 3rd version.
In this writeup, I use documentation from past versions to build up to the current version._

**Version 1.0**

In the summer of 2020, I made a Spotify tracker to collect my listening data and visualize it by mood.
I loved being able to access valence, danceability, and energy in the Spotify API.
I wanted to see if there were any patterns in my listening behavior.

<TwoCol>
**System Design**

I used a SUPER hacky solution to collect the data.
I used a scheduled task on my physical MacBook to run a Python script every 5 minutes.
The script would collect the song I was listening to and the time I listened to it.
Then, it would save the data in a CSV file in Github.

**Shortcomings**

<TwoCol>
**Reliability**

The site was not reliable. I collected songs using a scheduled task on my physical MacBook. So, if I had my computer turned off or was not connected to the internet, the data wouldn't be collected. The data was also stored in CSV files in Github. This is a crafty, free solution. However, this isn't best practice for storing lots of large data.

</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Plain HTML**

The site was made using plain HTML/JS/CSS.
This implementation was fine for this specific project,
but I wanted to practice making more modular sites for the next project (React).

</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Nonsensical**

The mood graph was non-sensical. I thought the mood indices provided by the Spotify API would be more insightful. But, the graphs didn't make much sense.

**Version 2.0**

For the second iteration, I focused on making a listening tracker that was
reliable, modular, and insightful.

In this version, the data is also all plotted by time of day (instead of mood).
Visitors can hover on a circle in the graph to play that song.
When a user drags their mouse over the graph, they can recreate a sort of "audio picture"
of my day.

**Sytem Design**

The system design doodle for this project is below. I focused on planning out the React
components since I was working with so much data.

**Shortcomings**

<TwoCol>
**Expensive**

Heroku changed their pricing model and
I found myself constantly buying add-ons due to the way
I set up my project with scheduled tasks and a SQL database.
For the next iteration, I wanted to transition to a free hosting version.

</TwoCol>

<TwoCol>
**Clunky**

In a nerdy way, I would mostly show this project to people
out in the real world, on my phone. The site was clunky to use on mobile. For
the next iteration, I wanted to focus on making this project more enjoyable on
mobile. I wanted to be able to scroll instead of click to see new days.

**Version 3.0 (current)**

And now, the current version!

<Line />

<TwoCol>
**Frontend**

For site visitors, all data can be see with a scroll.
Which means this is optimized for mobile.
So when I make a new friend and want to share my music taste, I don't have to hover
over the person and instruct them on how to view more data.

**Backend**

And for my wallet, I found a little hobby tier corner in the
cloud to host + store all my stuff for free.

I switched to Vercel to deploy the site which means I rebuilt the
entire backend data collection
pipeline using Next.js.

I switched to PlanetScale to host the SQL database. They have a generous
hobby tier that is free for small projects and fit the needs of trudy.tube.
