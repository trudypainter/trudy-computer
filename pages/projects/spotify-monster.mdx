    In the spring of my sophomore year, I took MIT's embedded systems class.
    For the final project, my group and I created a network of Tamagotchi-like
    creatures that were fed based off Spotify listening history.

    We used a Python web server, SQL database, Arduino with C++, and the Spotify API.
    We also created a web interface to view other monsters and compatibility
    scores between users.

**Introduction**

The Spotify Monster is a social network of Tamagotchi-like creatures
that are fed based off Spotify listening history.

The more music you listen to, the more your monster will grow.
And as the monster grows, it will reflect the type of music you listen to.

**Monster Design**

The monster's appearance is based off the user's music taste.
The design elements include body color, mood, age height, and trophy accessories.

**Body Color**

The monster's body color corresponds to the user's top listened to genre. The color codes are as follows:

**Pop**: pink  
**Country**: orange  
**Rap**: purple  
**Instrumental**: yellow  
**Electronic**: green  
**Rock/Alt**: red

**Mood**

Based off a user's listened to songs' valence, energy, and danceability,
we compute a mood score. This then correlates to 3 different facial
expressions for the monster: [0] sad, [1] neutral, or [2] happy.

**Age Stage**

When a user first starts listening, their monster is a baby.
As they listen to more songs, their monster will grow legs, arms,
height, and trophy accessories.

After 50 songs, the monster grows legs.

After 100 songs, the monster grows arms.

After 150 songs, the monster can start growing in height.

_We didn't want to put a ceiling on how much the monster could develop.
So, after a user listens to 150 songs, they earn an extra pixel of height._

**Trophy Accessories**

After listening to 500 songs in a certain genre,
a user can unlock a monster accessory for that genre. The accessories are as follows:

**Pop**: microphone  
**Country**: cowboy hat  
**Rap**: gold chain  
**Instrumental**: music stand  
**Techno**: DJ turntable  
**Rock/Alt**: electric guitar

**Example Monster**

Below is a tall monster with a netural mood, arms, and legs.
It also has a headphone, cowboy hat, and microphone accessory.

**System Modes**

<TwoCol>
**Single User Mode**

A user can view music listening stats and
play with their monster.

You can make your monster dance and jump.

**Multi User Mode**

Two monsters can interact with
each other across Arduinos.

If the users' listening history is highly compatible,
the Arduinos will dance with each other on the screen.

In the case below, they give a "thumbs up" to each other, inidicating
they are moderately compatible.

**Web Interface**

On the web interface, users can view all the monsters in the network.
Compatibility scores and recommended songs are generated between users.

The compatibility score is generated using a sigmoid function
based on how similar the users' music tastes are.

**System Specs**

Below is the system diagram for the project.

The Arduino is connected to a speaker and a screen.
The Arduino communicates with the Python web server for rendering calls.
The web server communicates with the SQL database, Spotify API, and voice recognition endpoint.
