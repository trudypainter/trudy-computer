# TRUDY.COMPUTER

!['test'](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/19472243/original_b54dd892c42651489e6895286183352b.jpg?1671376656?bc=0 'hey')

### Intentions

I wanted to make a website from scratch. I think [handmade websites](https://gossipsweb.net/) are [awesome](https://tilde.town/~zach/folk-html.html) and can be a great form of self expression.

There are lots of great [website generators](https://cargo.site/), but I wanted my website to be fully customizable and learn new skills during development.

When thinking about the [design of my personal website](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-make-a-website-for-your-creative-work/), I wanted to balance representing myself
personally and professionally. A lot of my web design inspiration is collected in this [Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/trudy-painter/ui-ux-e7l6cz6uksa).

I want to feel comfortable sending my website to friends AND employers.

### System Specs

The frontend is made with React and Next.js, deployed on Vercel. Posts are written with Markdown. I also used Prisma and Planet Scale to count the number of site visits.

The repo was adapted from [this blank Nextra repo](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/nextra-blank-custom-theme).

The current repository can be found [here](https://github.com/trudypainter/nextra-trudy-computer).

### Previous Versions

Since I use my personal website as a playground to try out new web stacks, my website has been through a _few_ iterations.
I used to use Flask, Heroku, and Notion for a backend. That was a fine approach, but it was slower than Vercel. And it was basically held together
by scotch tape and bamboo underneath.

Below is a screen recording of [my old website](https://github.com/trudypainter/trudy-computer-react) through!
