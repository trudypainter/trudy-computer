**Backstory**

I used to take daily pictures of my outfits on Instagram over quarantine. (No, I
am not going to provide a link - its embarassing now)

In my posts, I would included a slideshow of brands / things I had been liking recently.
I'm fan of Martine Rose and frequently posted her work.

A casting agency found the account and reached out asking if
I was interested in modeling for Martine Rose. Duh, I said yes.

Then, I worked with Martine Rose and her team to coordinate the shoot.
I set up a tripod and filmed myself hanging out in my childhood bedroom
in pieces from her Spring/Summer 2021 collection.

**Peronsal Note**

This was a surreal, super cool experience for me.

I'd always followed fashion, but from afar in the comfort of
my suburban childhood home. This experience was a peek into
fashion's creative process and all the work that goes into
a fashion show.

I feel grateful to Martine Rose for inviting me into her world.
She has a kind eye towards highlighting humans
and their individuality.

I'm an even bigger fan after working with her.

**The Show**

The show was a digital presentation that premiered on a livestream.
It was a mix of videos from models around the world in their homes,
including a surprise appearance from Drake.

**Setting**

The show was set in a virtual world that was a mix of
hotel and panopticon. Throughout the show, the camera
would pan to different rooms in the hotel, revealing
models in their rooms.
