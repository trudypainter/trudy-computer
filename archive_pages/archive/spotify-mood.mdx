# SPOTIFY MOOD TRACKER v1.0 

I wanted a way to track my mood with no extra effort. So, over the summer of 2020, I made this [Spotify mood tracker](https://spotify-mood-tp.herokuapp.com/). It tracks all of my listening history and generates a graph of mood indices calculated by song valence, energy, and danceability. 

Below is a diagram of how the system works. Check out the website [here](http://www.trudy.tube/) as well. 

Or, take a look at [how I made this.](https://github.com/trudypainter/spotify-mood)
